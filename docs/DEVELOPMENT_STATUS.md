# Development Status

## Current Sprint Status

### Completed
- âœ… Core battle system implementation with 100% test coverage
  - Pokemon system with stats, moves, and battle state
  - Move system with PP management and effects
  - Type system with effectiveness calculations
  - Battle mechanics with damage calculation
- âœ… Service layer implementation with 90%+ test coverage
  - PokemonFactory for entity creation
  - BattleManager for battle flow
  - GameState for progression tracking
- âœ… Terminal UI implementation
  - Battle view with Rich library integration
  - Input handling system
  - Game phase transitions
- âœ… Test Infrastructure
  - 76 tests covering core and service layers
  - pytest configuration with coverage reporting
  - Mock system for UI testing

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ UI Layer Testing
  - Battle view tests (80% complete)
  - Input handler tests (100% complete)
  - Need to add integration tests
- ðŸ”„ Item System Design
  - Data structure planning
  - Integration with battle system
  - Reward mechanics

### Blocked
- â›” Save/Load system (waiting for item system)
- â›” Browser UI (pending core feature completion)

## Test Coverage

### Core Domain (100%)
- pokemon.py: 98%
- move.py: 100%
- types.py: 100%
- battle.py: 86%

### Services (90%+)
- pokemon_factory.py: 100%
- battle_manager.py: 93%
- game_state.py: 92%

### UI
- battle_view.py: In progress
- input_handler.py: 100%

## Known Issues

### Critical
None currently.

### High Priority
1. Battle weather effects not fully implemented
2. Status effect duration not tracked
3. Missing test coverage for battle edge cases

### Medium Priority
1. Move PP not restored between battles
2. Type effectiveness messages could be more descriptive
3. Battle log limited to 5 messages

### Low Priority
1. Terminal UI could use more color
2. Move descriptions not displayed
3. Stats display could be more detailed

## Technical Debt

### Code
1. Battle class has some complex methods needing refactoring
2. GameState class handling too many responsibilities
3. Some duplicate code in test fixtures

### Testing
1. UI layer needs complete test coverage
2. Integration tests needed for full game flow
3. Performance tests needed for battle calculations

### Documentation
1. JSON data format needs schema documentation
2. API documentation could be more detailed
3. Missing architecture diagrams

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. Complete UI layer tests
   - Add missing battle view tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Coverage target: 80%+

2. Begin item system
   - Design data structure
   - Create Item class
   - Implement basic effects

3. Enhance battle system
   - Complete weather effects
   - Add status effect duration
   - Improve message system

### Short Term (1-2 Sprints)
1. Save/Load system design
2. More Pokemon and moves
3. Achievement system

### Long Term
1. Browser UI migration
2. Online features
3. Custom Pokemon creation

## Environment Setup Issues

### Known Setup Problems
1. venv activation might fail on some Windows systems
   - Solution: Use `python -m venv venv` instead
2. Rich library may have display issues in some terminals
   - Solution: Configure terminal to use UTF-8

### Common Runtime Issues
1. JSON data load failures
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify JSON format
2. Terminal display glitches
   - Ensure terminal supports UTF-8
   - Check Rich compatibility

## Performance Metrics

### Current
- Test suite execution: ~0.8s
- Game startup time: ~1s
- Battle calculation time: <0.1s

### Targets
- Test suite: <1s
- Game startup: <2s
- Battle calculation: <0.2s
