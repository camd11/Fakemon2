## Current Focus: Ability System Implementation

### Status
Currently working on implementing and testing the Pokemon ability system, particularly focusing on status effect immunities and resistances.

### Components

#### Ability System (src/core/ability.py)
- Implemented base Ability class with support for:
  - Status immunities (completely prevents specific status effects)
  - Status resistances (reduces chance of status effects)
- Ability types are defined in AbilityType enum:
  - STATUS_IMMUNITY
  - STATUS_RESISTANCE

#### Battle System Integration (src/core/battle.py)
- Modified battle system to handle abilities during:
  - Status effect application
  - Accuracy checks
  - Move execution
- Recent changes:
  - Separated accuracy checks for status moves vs. non-status moves
  - Fixed status chance calculation to properly handle resistance multipliers

### Testing Status (tests/core/test_ability.py)

#### Working Tests
1. Status Immunity Test (PASSING)
   - Verifies abilities can completely prevent specific status effects
   - Tests both immunity to specified status and ability to receive other status effects

2. Multiple Status Immunities Test (PASSING)
   - Verifies abilities can prevent multiple status effects
   - Tests immunity to multiple specified statuses while allowing other status effects

#### Current Issues
1. Status Resistance Test (FAILING)
   - Test verifies that abilities can reduce the chance of status effects
   - Expected: ~50% success rate for status application with resistance ability
   - Current: Getting much lower success rate (~0.7%)
   - Potential issues being investigated:
     - Status chance calculation in battle.py
     - Accuracy check application for status moves
     - Type chart handling in test setup

### Next Steps

1. Fix Status Resistance Implementation
   - Debug status chance calculation in battle.py
   - Verify resistance multiplier application
   - Ensure proper handling of accuracy checks for status moves

2. Additional Testing Needed
   - Add tests for:
     - Multiple status resistances
     - Combined immunity and resistance abilities
     - Edge cases (100% and 0% chances)
     - Interaction with type immunities

3. Documentation Updates
   - Add ability documentation to DESIGN.md
   - Update battle system documentation with ability interactions
   - Add examples of ability usage to code comments

### Technical Notes

#### Status Effect Application Flow
1. Move execution (battle.py:execute_turn)
2. Effect processing (battle.py:execute_turn -> effects loop)
3. Status chance calculation
   - Base chance from move effect
   - Resistance multiplier from ability (if any)
4. Status application attempt (pokemon.py:set_status)
   - Immunity check
   - Current status check
   - Type immunity check

#### Key Files
- src/core/ability.py: Core ability implementation
- src/core/battle.py: Battle system and ability integration
- src/core/pokemon.py: Pokemon status handling
- tests/core/test_ability.py: Ability system tests

### Known Issues
1. Status resistance test failing
   - Current success rate: 0.7%
   - Expected success rate: 45-55%
   - Investigation ongoing

2. Accuracy handling
   - Need to verify accuracy checks don't interfere with status moves
   - Currently implementing separate handling for status vs. non-status moves

### Dependencies
- Python 3.12.3
- pytest 7.4.3
- Type system from core/types.py
- Status effects from core/move.py

### Code Style Notes
- Using dataclasses for result objects
- Enums for type safety
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints throughout
- Test-driven development approach

### Future Considerations
1. Performance optimization
   - Status check calculations
   - Battle system efficiency

2. Extensibility
   - Support for more complex abilities
   - Weather-based abilities
   - Stat-modifying abilities

3. Error Handling
   - Add more robust error checking
   - Improve error messages
   - Add logging for debugging
