# Development Status

## Status Effect System (Completed)

The status effect system has been fully implemented with the following features:

### Core Components

1. **Pokemon Class (`src/core/pokemon.py`)**
   - Status tracking with optional duration
   - Status clear message generation
   - Stat stage modifications for status effects
   - Prevention of multiple status effects

2. **Battle Class (`src/core/battle.py`)**
   - End-of-turn status effect processing
   - Status message handling
   - Damage calculations for poison
   - Turn skip chance for paralysis

### Implemented Status Effects

1. **Poison**
   - Deals 1/8 max HP damage at end of turn
   - Persists until cured or duration expires
   - Messages: "[Pokemon] was poisoned!", "[Pokemon] is hurt by poison!"

2. **Paralysis**
   - 25% chance to skip turn with message "[Pokemon] is fully paralyzed!"
   - Reduces speed to 1/4 of normal value
   - Persists until cured or duration expires

3. **Sleep**
   - Prevents moves completely with message "[Pokemon] is fast asleep!"
   - Lasts 1-3 turns randomly
   - No stat modifications
   - Messages: "[Pokemon] fell asleep!", "[Pokemon] is fast asleep!"

4. **Burn**
   - Deals 1/16 max HP damage at end of turn
   - Halves physical attack power
   - Lasts 5 turns
   - Messages: "[Pokemon] was burned!", "[Pokemon] is hurt by its burn!"

### Status Effect Duration

- Status effects can be applied with an optional duration
- Duration decreases by 1 each turn
- Status is automatically cleared when duration reaches 0
- Clear message: "[Pokemon]'s [status] faded!"

### Testing

All status effect functionality is verified by tests in `tests/core/test_battle_status.py`:
- `test_poison_damage`: Verifies poison damage calculation
- `test_paralysis_speed_reduction`: Checks speed stat modification
- `test_paralysis_skip_turn`: Validates turn skip probability
- `test_status_duration`: Tests duration tracking and clearing
- `test_status_messages`: Verifies message generation
- `test_multiple_status_effects`: Ensures only one status at a time
- `test_sleep_prevents_moves`: Verifies sleep prevents all moves
- `test_sleep_duration`: Validates random sleep duration (1-3 turns)

### Ability System

Status-related abilities have been implemented:

1. **Core Components**
   - Ability class with type and effect tracking
   - Integration with Pokemon class
   - Status immunity checking in set_status

2. **Implemented Abilities**
   - Immunity: Prevents all status conditions
   - Limber: Prevents paralysis
   - Water Veil: Prevents burns
   - Vital Spirit: Prevents sleep
   - Magma Armor: Prevents freezing

3. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive tests for each ability
   - Verification of ability-type immunity interactions
   - Edge case testing for ability-less Pokemon

### Item System

Status-curing items have been implemented:

1. **Core Components**
   - Enhanced ItemEffect with status-specific curing
   - Integration with Pokemon status system
   - Validation of item usage based on status

### Future Improvements

Potential areas for expansion:
1. Additional status effects (Freeze)
2. Additional ability types (Weather, Stats, etc.)
3. Additional item types (Held items, Battle items)
4. Moves that have increased effect chance on status-afflicted Pokemon

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining status effects (Freeze)
2. Add additional ability types (Weather, Stats)
3. Add held item functionality
