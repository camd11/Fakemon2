# Development Status

## Debugging Approach

When debugging probability-based tests:

1. Add detailed logging at each step of the calculation to understand the flow:
   - Initial values
   - Any modifications (e.g., resistance multipliers)
   - Final values
   - Results of random checks
   - Status of affected entities

2. Consider resource management:
   - Check if resources (like PP) are being properly managed
   - Restore resources between test iterations if needed
   - Verify resource state affects test outcomes

3. Statistical considerations:
   - Use appropriate sample sizes (e.g., 100+ trials for probability tests)
   - Allow reasonable ranges for random variation (e.g., ±10% from expected)
   - Document expected vs actual results

4. Test cleanup:
   - Reset state between trials
   - Verify reset was successful
   - Ensure independent trials

Example: Status Resistance Test Fix
- Problem: Status resistance test failing (~0.8% success vs expected 50%)
- Debug steps:
  1. Added logging for status chance calculation
  2. Tracked PP usage and status application
  3. Found PP depletion affecting results
  4. Adjusted success rate range for random variation
- Solution:
  1. Restore PP between trials
  2. Widened acceptable range (40-60%) for random variation
  3. Maintained 100 trials for statistical significance

## Current Focus: Weather System Implementation

### Status
Weather system implementation is complete with comprehensive test coverage. The system handles weather effects, duration, and interactions with moves and Pokemon types.

### Components

#### Weather System (src/core/battle.py)
- Implemented Weather enum with types:
  - CLEAR: Default weather state
  - RAIN: Boosts water moves, weakens fire moves
  - SUN: Boosts fire moves, weakens water moves
  - SANDSTORM: Damages non-Rock/Ground/Steel types
  - HAIL: Damages non-Ice types
- Weather effects include:
  - Move type modification (1.5x boost or 0.5x reduction)
  - End-of-turn damage for applicable types
  - Proper duration tracking and expiration

#### Battle System Integration
- Modified battle system to handle:
  - Weather-based damage calculations
  - Type-specific immunities to weather damage
  - Weather duration and state changes
  - Weather effect messages and timing

### Testing Status (tests/core/test_battle_weather.py)

#### Working Tests
1. Rain Boost Test (PASSING)
   - Verifies water moves are boosted by 1.5x
   - Verifies fire moves are weakened by 0.5x
   - Handles random variation in damage calculations

2. Sun Boost Test (PASSING)
   - Verifies fire moves are boosted by 1.5x
   - Verifies water moves are weakened by 0.5x
   - Includes retry logic for critical hits

3. Sandstorm Damage Test (PASSING)
   - Verifies damage to non-immune types
   - Confirms immunity for Rock/Ground/Steel types
   - Tests correct damage calculation (1/16 max HP)

4. Hail Damage Test (PASSING)
   - Verifies damage to non-Ice types
   - Confirms immunity for Ice types
   - Tests correct damage calculation (1/16 max HP)

5. Weather Duration Test (PASSING)
   - Verifies weather persists for correct duration
   - Tests weather message ordering
   - Confirms proper weather clearing

### Next Steps

1. Improve Battle System Coverage
   - ✓ Add tests for weather effects
   - Add tests for stat changes
   - Add tests for move accuracy
   - Add tests for critical hits

2. Implement New Features
   - Weather-based abilities
   - Stat-modifying abilities
   - Move-enhancing abilities

3. Additional Testing Needed
   - Add tests for weather-ability interactions
   - Test weather changes mid-battle
   - Test edge cases with weather duration

### Technical Notes

#### Weather Effect Flow
1. Move execution
   - Apply weather modifiers to move damage
   - Handle type-specific boosts/reductions
2. End of turn
   - Apply weather damage if applicable
   - Check immunities
   - Update duration
   - Handle weather expiration

#### Key Files
- src/core/battle.py: Weather implementation
- tests/core/test_battle_weather.py: Weather system tests

### Dependencies
- Python 3.12.3
- pytest 7.4.3
- Type system from core/types.py

### Code Style Notes
- Using enums for weather types
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints throughout
- Test-driven development approach

### Future Considerations
1. Performance optimization
   - Weather effect calculations
   - Battle system efficiency

2. Extensibility
   - Support for temporary weather changes
   - Weather-based abilities
   - Complex weather interactions

3. Error Handling
   - Add validation for weather duration
   - Improve error messages
   - Add debugging support
