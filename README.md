### Local Development

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fakemon2.git
cd Fakemon2
```

3. Set up the upstream remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-username/Fakemon2.git
```

4. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

3. Keep your fork up to date:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

4. Push your changes:
```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

5. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

## Running the Game

From the project root directory:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## How to Play

1. Choose a starter Pokemon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle)
2. Battle through increasingly difficult Pokemon
3. Use your moves strategically, considering:
   - Type effectiveness
   - PP management
   - Status effects
4. Catch wild Pokemon to build your team (5 Pokeballs to start)
5. Progress through 200 levels to win

### Battle Controls

- 1: Fight (then choose a move 1-4)
- 2: Pokemon (switch Pokemon - future feature)
- 3: Item (use Pokeball)
- 4: Run (disabled in roguelike mode)

## Project Structure

- `src/core/`: Core game mechanics and entities
- `src/services/`: Game state and business logic
- `src/data/`: Game data in JSON format
- `src/ui/`: Terminal user interface
- `docs/`: Design documentation and changelog
- `tests/`: Test suite (future addition)

## Development Status

### Completed Features
- Core battle system with type effectiveness and status effects
- Pokemon management with stats and moves
- Basic roguelike progression system
- Terminal-based UI using Rich library
- Comprehensive test suite (52 tests, 90%+ coverage for core/services)

### Current Focus
- UI layer testing implementation
- Item system design and development
- Battle system enhancements

See [DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for detailed architecture and current status.
Changes are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run tests to verify setup:
```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

3. Start the game:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

### Development Process

1. Check current issues and project board
2. Create a new branch for your feature
3. Write tests first (TDD approach)
4. Implement the feature
5. Ensure tests pass and coverage maintains
6. Update documentation
7. Create pull request

### Code Organization

- `src/core/`: Core game mechanics (Pokemon, moves, battles)
- `src/services/`: Game state and business logic
- `src/data/`: JSON data files
- `src/ui/`: Terminal interface components
- `tests/`: Test suite organized by component
- `docs/`: Design docs and changelog

### Testing

Run different test configurations:
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python3 -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python3 -m pytest tests/core/test_pokemon.py

# Run tests matching pattern
python3 -m pytest -k "battle"
```

Coverage reports are generated in `htmlcov/`.

### Documentation

Keep these up to date when making changes:
1. Update docstrings for new code
2. Modify DESIGN.md for architectural changes
3. Add significant changes to CHANGELOG.md
4. Update JSON schemas if data structure changes

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- âœ… Core battle system
- âœ… Basic game progression
- âœ… Terminal UI
- ðŸ”„ UI testing
- ðŸ”„ Item system

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Advanced battle mechanics
- Save/Load system
- More Pokemon and moves
- Achievement system

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Browser-based UI
- Online features
- Custom Pokemon creation

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Pokemon
1. Add entry to `src/data/pokemon.json`
2. Update type effectiveness if needed
3. Add new moves if required
4. Update tests
5. Verify in game

### Implementing New Features
1. Start with core domain in `src/core/`
2. Add necessary data files
3. Implement service layer integration
4. Add UI components
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

### Debugging
1. Check test coverage for affected area
2. Use Rich library's console.print for debugging
3. Verify JSON data integrity
4. Check game state transitions

## Getting Help

1. Check existing tests for examples
2. Review DESIGN.md for architecture
3. Examine JSON files for data structures
4. Look for similar implementations in codebase

## Contributing
