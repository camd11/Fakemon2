## Testing

Run different test configurations:
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python3 -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python3 -m pytest tests/core/test_pokemon.py

# Run tests matching pattern
python3 -m pytest -k "battle"
```

Coverage reports are generated in `htmlcov/`.

## Current Test Coverage

- Core domain: 91-100%
