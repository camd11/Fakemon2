# Development Guidelines

## Development Workflow

Our development follows a systematic, test-driven approach with clear phases:

### 1. Feature Planning
- Review the next feature from the development roadmap
- Break down the feature into manageable components
- Identify dependencies and potential impacts on existing code

### 2. Test-Driven Development
1. **Write Tests First**
   - Create comprehensive test cases before implementation
   - Cover core functionality, edge cases, and error conditions
   - Ensure tests are clear and maintainable

2. **Implement Feature**
   - Write code to make tests pass
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Keep changes focused and modular

3. **Refactor**
   - Clean up code while keeping tests passing
   - Look for opportunities to improve design
   - Ensure code remains readable and maintainable

### 3. Documentation
1. **Update Changelog**
   - Document new features, changes, and fixes
   - Use clear, descriptive language
   - Include relevant details about functionality

2. **Update Development Status**
   - Document completed components
   - List implemented features and capabilities
   - Update next steps and future improvements

3. **Update Technical Documentation**
   - Add/update API documentation
   - Document new interfaces or changes
   - Include usage examples where helpful

### 4. Code Review & Integration
1. **Self Review**
   - Review all changes for quality and completeness
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Check documentation accuracy

2. **Version Control**
   - Create meaningful commit messages
   - Group related changes in single commits
   - Push changes to repository

### Benefits of This Workflow
- Ensures high-quality, well-tested code
- Maintains clear project history and documentation
- Makes future development easier
- Helps new team members understand the codebase
- Reduces technical debt

## Best Practices

### Testing
- Write tests before implementing features
- Cover both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Keep tests focused and readable

### Documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code
- Use clear, consistent formatting
- Include examples where helpful
- Document both what and why

### Code Quality
- Follow project coding standards
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Keep functions and classes focused
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions

### Version Control
- Make frequent, small commits
- Write clear commit messages
- Keep changes focused and related
- Review changes before committing

## Project Structure

### Source Code
- Organize code logically by feature/module
- Keep related files together
- Use consistent file naming
- Follow language/framework conventions

### Tests
- Mirror source code structure
- Name tests clearly and consistently
- Group related tests together
- Include setup and teardown as needed

### Documentation
- Maintain separate docs for different purposes
- Use clear hierarchical structure
- Keep documentation close to relevant code
- Update docs with code changes

## Conclusion

Following these guidelines helps maintain a high-quality codebase that is:
- Well-tested and reliable
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Well-documented and accessible
- Ready for future development
